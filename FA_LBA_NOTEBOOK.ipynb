    "In a second scenario where the number of hydrants is related with the height of buildings in a block, the number of hydrants is affected by the height of buildings, because it will be only installed in a bigger number of hydrants if the buildings are very tall which is related to the occupancy of people, so that the height of it is the independent variable and the number of hydrants is the dependent variable. In this case, a possible confounding variable would be a scenario where the number of hydrants isn’t only related to the height of buildings, but also to the hydraulic capacity of the system. So, even if we had tall buildings, but poor hydraulic capacity we would still have a low number of hydrants. In this case, the possible behavior of the graph is to evolve linearly until 25 stories, after that the behavior stabilizes."

Whereas a residential neighborhood has on average between 2 or 3 hydrants per block, California Street between Nob Hill and Financial District has on average 9.4 hydrants per block. In addition, there is a relative small difference between mean and median, in this case, mean is lower than median, so that the graph is left-skewed, it means that the number of hydrants tend to be closer to the high number of it. By knwowing how to calculate the mean, median, and mode I can interpret correctely the data that I have, for example, all those data can help to understand what is the possible hydrant's system in the neighborhood, as a proof, the mean shows that the neighborhood has more structure than others, the relationship between mean and median shows that, though there is a difference of number of hydrants per block, the discrepancy isn't big.
